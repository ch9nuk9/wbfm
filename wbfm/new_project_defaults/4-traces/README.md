# README for traces

Traces are the summed pixel brightness of the 3d mask; see the paper for more details.

Note that the red.h5 and green.h5 files are the true raw traces, with no preprocessing (except summing the pixel values) at all. In particular, there is no background subtraction or bleach correction.
